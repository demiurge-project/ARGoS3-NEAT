In this directory, you will find at least:

* CMakeLists: file containing the cmake instructions.
* evolution-sequential: Main program that does the link between NEAT (the evolutionary process) and ARGoS (the robot simulator in which the experiment is launched). It can only launch the experiment sequentially.
* main: Main program that does the link between NEAT (the evolutionary process) and ARGoS (the robot simulator in which the experiment is launched). It can launch the experiment in parallel or sequentially.
* prog: If the program is launched in parallel, each child process will execute this program.
* Evostick : is the argos wrapper that can handle genome file arguments

%%%%%% CREATE YOUR OWN EXPERIMENT %%%%%%

- If you want to use just NEAT without the simulator ARGoS. You will need to modify the main program: in the main method, you will need to initialize your own experiment, then call the method launchNEAT(…) by passing your own defined method as a parameter.
launchNEAT(…) is a method that expects at least 3 arguments: the neat parameters file, the starter genome and your function that launches your experiment and evaluates an organism/network or population on this one. This method will set the evolutionary process and will call your method in which you are supposed to launch your experiment and evaluate the organisms/networks. After calling your method, launchNEAT(…) will evolve the population for the next generation.

Your method should accept only one parameter NEAT::Network& or NEAT::Population&.
-> If your method has NEAT::Network& as a parameter: you should, after launching the experiment and evaluating this network on it, return the fitness value.
-> If your method has NEAT::Population& as a parameter: you should launch the experiment for each organism and evaluate each one of them. Your method doesn’t need to return anything.
